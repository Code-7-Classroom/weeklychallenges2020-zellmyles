// VERY HARD: You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. 
// Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. 
// If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.




// Coins of different denominations will go into an array
// Set target amount
// Find highest number in array
// Find lowest number in array



const arr = [10,5,2,1]    // Can any of these be added up to get our target amount? (10 + 10 + 5 = 25) 3 coins

const amount = 25

fewestNum = (arr, amount) => {
    const highNum = math.max(arr)
    const lowNum = math.min(arr)
    
}
