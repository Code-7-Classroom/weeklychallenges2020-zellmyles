                arch-nemesis, The Joker is on the loose,
                spreading fear and panic throughout the streets! His diabolical arsenal of weapons seem at first like
                harmless practical jokes, but in reality are tools of mayhem and destruction. Be on the lookout for his
                joy-buzzer, which delivers a lethal electric charge, and his trick flower, which squirts a powerful
                acid. The most dangerous item in his arsenal is the secret weapon, Smylex, a chemical which gives its
                victims a permanent, hideous grin!</p>
