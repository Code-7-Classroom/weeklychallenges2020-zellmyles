Var - Var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. They can be re-declared and updated.

Let - Let is block scoped. A variable declared in a block with the let is only available for use within that block. It can be updated but not re-declared.

Const - Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations. Const declarations are block scoped. Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block it was declared. It cannot be updated or re-declared.
