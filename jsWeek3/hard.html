    <h1>HARD: Data security exercise. Inside of a closure, create an object called pii (Personally Identifiable
        Information)that cannot be accessed directly.
        The object should have at least two properties: name and ssn.
        Only the name property should be accessible, and it should be called through a public function.
        The ssn property should not be accessible at all.
